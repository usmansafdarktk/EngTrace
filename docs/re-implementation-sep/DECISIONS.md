# Decision and pivot log

Running record of every decision, reversal and scope change on the template
redesign work. **Append-only.** When a decision is superseded, mark the old
entry `SUPERSEDED` and add a new one — never edit history, because the reason a
decision changed is usually more useful later than the decision itself.

## D-001 — Proceed with milestone verification, with a modified design

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** audit report §1

The hypothesis holds: 93% of f-string interpolations are already bound
variables, and 94.5% of step-result numbers are recoverable from the generator's
locals. Instrumentation is *emission*, not rewriting.

Three framing assumptions dropped:

1. **Static milestone declaration is impossible.** 48% of templates change the
   governing equation, step count, or milestone set with the sample. The trace
   must be emitted per instance.
2. **"Milestone = scalar with a unit" is insufficient.** 61 of 150 templates
   carry non-scalar content.
3. **"No LLM in the critical path" cannot be claimed universally.** ~13% of the
   corpus cannot be verified numerically in principle. The defensible claim is
   "deterministic verification for N of 150, remainder explicitly scoped".

## D-002 — Do the extractor before instrumenting templates

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** audit report §9, §11.3

The binding constraint is the *model* side, not the template side.
`engineering_parser.py` reduces a solution to one unitless float, reads
`**4,921**` as `4.0`, and cannot see the `**Final Answer**` marker five
templates use. 74.7% of gold answer blocks hold more than one distinct number.

Instrumenting 150 templates while the model side still yields one float
produces a structured gold trace with nothing to compare against. The extractor
spike is the gate for the whole project.

## D-003 — Parser fix and re-score are urgent and independent

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** OPEN (blocked on a dependency check)

The thousands-separator bug corrupts the gold reference for two templates in
100% of instances; ≥43 archived rows state the correct value and are scored 0.
Two-line fix.

**Blocking dependency:** `inference_results/` and `evaluation_results/` are
gitignored and **absent from this working copy**. If the raw generations were
retained elsewhere this is a free re-score; if not it needs full re-inference
across 11 models × 1,350 items, which is a budget decision.
**Action: establish which, before promising a corrected table.**

## D-004 — `damping_classification`: constrain the sample so `c_c` is exact

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** SUPERSEDED by D-010 · **Source:** spec §1.3

Original reasoning: after applying P3, ζ recomputed from a 2-dp `c` would never
equal exactly 1.0, so "Critically Damped" becomes unreachable. Verified 680,869
feasible (k, m) pairs exist within current ranges, so constraining the sample
was feasible and preserved all three classes.

---

## D-005 — `normal_depth_iteration`: schema `iteration` node, not a fixed count

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** spec §3.1

Fixing the iteration count converts "iterate until converged" into "perform
three updates" — a materially easier item. The convergence count is genuinely
data-dependent (2–6 evaluations measured).

*Reverses if:* the milestone model is frozen before Phase 3 and cannot take a
new node type. Then fix the count and record the P6 trade.

---

## D-006 — `line_balancing_heuristic`: schema `decision` node (REVERSAL)

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED — reverses an earlier recommendation
**Source:** spec §3.2

**Originally recommended** redesigning to a fixed-shape decision table.
**Reversed** on the same objection that rules out fixing the iteration count in
D-005: the **station count is a computed result**, and line efficiency is a
function of it. Fixing it leaks part of the answer.

`iteration` and `decision` turn out to be the same shape — an ordered list of
homogeneous sub-traces with stable within-element symbols and a termination
predicate — so specifying them together is cheaper than two bespoke redesigns,
and generalises to `linear_reservoir_routing_step` and `qr_policy_one_iteration`.

## D-007 — Answer marker: normalise gold, keep the extractor permissive

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** spec §5

Normalise the five chemical templates to `**Answer:**` rather than widening the
accepted set, which would have to be known by every downstream consumer and
would drift.

**The asymmetry is the point:** strictness applies to *gold traces only*. The
extractor reading **model** output must stay permissive — models emit "Final
answer:", bare headings, or nothing.

---

## D-008 — Item-pool regeneration: split by cost

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** spec §5 decision 5

- **Parser fix → re-score only, immediately** (no items change, no re-inference).
- **Template changes → regenerate once, after Phase 6.** Per-phase regeneration
  would invalidate comparisons repeatedly.

---

## D-009 — Constants re-grounding runs as a parallel Track B, not a Track A phase

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** spec Track B

Only a small slice gates Track A: `CP_PARAMS`, `HEATS_OF_FORMATION` and
`COMBUSTION_REACTIONS` — 65 values in three tables, all consumed by one file
(`heat_effects.py`, 5 templates). That is a 15–25 h job, not the 87–150 h track.

Two hard sync points: **S1** (C2 before Phase 2, so determinism is not verified
against 10×-wrong Cp data) and **S2** (C3 before Phase 6, so the item pool is
regenerated exactly once).

## D-010 — `damping_classification` is ill-posed, not wrong (SUPERSEDES D-004)

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** two independent oracle
agents; corroborated against D0.5 §4c

Two agents, working from different briefs, independently concluded the gold
label is **correct**. Both reproduced the audit's ~33.7–35% flip rate under a
strict `zeta == 1` test, then showed **every flip lies within 1.0× the half-unit
uncertainty of the 2-dp damping coefficient** (max ratio 0.99). The stated data
is consistent with `c = c_c` to its own printed precision.

The audit's 35% figure assumes exact float equality as the classification rule.
No solver reading `c` to 2 dp could conclude "Overdamped" from ζ = 1.000000854527.

**Revised fix: state `c` to more digits** (or state it as equal to the critical
value) and drop the fragile `elif zeta == 1` float test. Constraining the
sample (D-004) is no longer needed.

**Also recorded:** D0.5 found audit claim 4c **false as stated** — the flips are
~50/50 Overdamped/Underdamped (89/86), not all Overdamped, and the Underdamped
half is worse than described because gold then omits the ω_d step those
instances require.

## D-011 — Phase 1 grows from 9 templates to 12

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** `phase0_baseline.md`
NEW-1 and §6

D0.5 found three more templates with the same defect shape:

| Template | Closure failure |
|---|---|
| `template_beam_deflection_formula` | 5.89% of SI instances |
| `template_statically_indeterminate_shaft` | 47% |
| `template_shaft_design_power` | 30% |

`beam_deflection_formula` should be fixed **first**, because it is the pattern
the others copy (see D-012).

---

## D-012 — P2 amended: break the rounding tie in decimal, not on the binary float

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** `phase0_baseline.md`
NEW-1 / SPEC-2 · **Severity: this invalidated the original Phase 1 recipe**

P2's own worked exemplar, `template_beam_deflection_formula`, applies P2
correctly — `delta = round(delta, 5)` before use — and **still** fails printed-
arithmetic closure on 5.89% of SI instances:

```
0.01185 * 1000  ->  binary 11.85  ->  round() gives 11.8;  decimal half-up gives 11.9
```

Rounding to display precision removes the *double* rounding but leaves an exact
half-way tie that Python resolves on the binary value. **P2 as written is
necessary but not sufficient.**

Applied as originally specified to the other eight Phase 1 templates, the
transformation would have reproduced this residue eight more times. Caught by
the Phase 0 gate before any template was edited — which is the clearest
justification in this project for not compressing Phase 0.

**Amendment:** quantise in decimal — `Decimal(f"{x:.5f}") * 1000` with
`ROUND_HALF_UP` — not `round(x * 1000, 1)`.

## D-013 — Four Phase 1 templates are not chain-break defects

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** independent T2 oracles,
reconciled against D0.5

Round-trip oracles (question → answer, computation code withheld) split the
original nine Phase 1 templates into three categories rather than one:

| Category | Templates | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Chain break** — the answer is wrong from the stated givens | `mean_variance` (56.8%), `rotating_unbalance` (4.6% @ 0.5% tol, worst 8.43%), `vibration_transmissibility` | P3: state, then recompute forward |
| **Display defect** — the answer round-trips, an intermediate line does not | `cantilever_double_integration` (3.7% of Step-6 lines), `annulus_flowrate` (94% of Step-5 products) | P2 as amended by D-012 |
| **Not defective** | `poissons_ratio`, `logarithmic_decrement`, `system_properties` | none — see below |

**Reconciliation with D0.5.** The oracles and D0.5 appear to disagree; they do
not. D0.5 asked *"does a strict recomputation flip the label / fail to close?"*
and found the audit's rates reproduce. The oracles asked *"can a solver reach
the gold answer from the stated givens?"* and often found yes. Both are correct.
What is contested is **interpretation** — whether a line-level defect makes a
template a chain break — not measurement. An earlier summary of mine framed
this as the audit's claims failing to survive; that was wrong and is corrected
here.

**On the three "not defective":** `poissons_ratio`'s sign leak is a
*presentation* inconsistency (the question states |P| with "(compression)" in
prose while the trace prints a negative), and it affects US-customary instances
too, so the audit's "76/300 SI" undercounts the phenomenon.
`logarithmic_decrement`'s input back-solving is deliberate — the
measurement-uncertainty framing of the exercise. `system_properties`' residue is
two orders below its print precision.

## D-014 — R6 review scoping added after a review stalled

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED · **Source:** SPEC-CHANGE 4

The first Phase 0 adversary brief bundled the gate task with re-deriving three
audit claims — work already assigned, in the same batch by the same author, to
the D0.5 agent. It ran 45 minutes past its last write and produced nothing;
D0.5 delivered the superset in 23 minutes. **The only mandatory task went
unanswered because it was bundled with duplicated work.**

R6 now requires: one mandatory gate task, a stated time box, a measurement
ownership register with no number appearing twice, tooling supplied as working
code, and settled questions explicitly fenced off. Re-dispatched under those
rules the review was tractable and found a genuine blind spot (see D-015).

## D-015 — Two harness defects that made a check measure nothing

**Date:** 2026-09-05 · **Status:** DECIDED (both fixed) · **Source:** self-caught
and adversary review F1

Recorded because both are the same failure mode — **a check that reports green
while testing nothing** — and both would have silently invalidated a phase gate.

1. **T3 seeded numpy.** `seed_all()` seeded numpy as well as `random`, so both
   of T3's processes reproduced the unseeded `np.random` draw and T3 **passed**
   `template_levenspiel_plot_interpretation` — the one template it exists to
   catch. Fixed: T3's children seed only `random`. Verified 40/40 seeds now
   differ.
2. **T1 was blind to prose-labelled lines.** A colon-prefixed label made
   `_strip_units` treat "Row sum" as an operand symbol, poisoning the segment,
   which then landed in the same bucket as a legitimate formula-only step. The
   adversary planted `Row sum: 0.4347 + 0.2952 + 0.2701 = 1.5000 = 1` — a gross
   non-closure — and the whole suite passed it. Fixed: `:` is a clause
   separator. Verified the defect now fails, the correct version passes, and
   corpus failures are unchanged at 38.

**Lesson to carry:** a green check is not evidence until something known-broken
has been shown to turn it red.
